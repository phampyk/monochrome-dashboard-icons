# Monochrome Dashboard Icons
I would like to give back to the self-hosted community by sharing my SVG monochrome icons that I made for my own [flame](https://github.com/pawelmalak/flame) dashboard instance.

Hopefully someone else can use them to make beautiful dashboards.

If you need an icon open an issue and I'll try my best to accomodate your request.

If you are looking for original colored icons [Dashboard Icons](https://github.com/walkxcode/dashboard-icons) have you covered.

*_NOTE_*: I don't own the rights to any of these icons, I just made and compiled monochrome versions of them, credits to their original creators.
