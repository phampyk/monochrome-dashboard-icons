# Monochrome Dashboard Icons
I would like to give back to the self-hosted community by sharing my SVG monochrome icons that I made for my own [flame](https://github.com/pawelmalak/flame) dashboard instance.

Hopefully someone else can use them to make beautiful dashboards.

If you need an icon open an issue and I'll try my best to accomodate your request.

*NOTE*: I don't own the rights to any of these icons, I just made and compiled monochrome versions of them, credits to their original creators.
